ZeroTouch Replatform: A software tool designed to automate the process of replatforming existing applications to a cloud-native architecture.
By analyzing an existing codebase, generating necessary boilerplate code, externalizing configurations, and modifying build pipelines,
ZeroTouch Replatform minimizes the need for manual intervention, making the transition to the cloud as seamless as possible.

Modernization Council: A team of architects directing the transition of legacy applications to cloud-native architecture.
The Council conducts in-depth analysis, provides strategic solutions, and ensures successful replatforming, serving as key advisors in the modernization journey.

Modernization Index: A numerical score, ranging from 1 to 100, representing the readiness of an application for transition to a cloud-native architecture.
The index is determined by assessing factors such as technical debt, cloud-native compliance, scalability, resilience, security, regulatory compliance,
integration complexity, performance requirements, business continuity needs, data migration challenges, and organizational readiness.
A higher score indicates a greater readiness for modernization and a more cloud-ready state of the application.
